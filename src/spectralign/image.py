    """A representation of an image as a 2D array

    Images can be constructed in several ways:

    * from numpy arrays using

          img = Image(array)

    * loaded from an image file using

          img = Image.load(filename)

    * pulled from a video file using

          vidcap = cv2.VideoCapture(inputfilename)
          ...
          img = Image.readframe(vidcap)

      In this case, a RuntimeError is raised at end-of-file.

    Our native data format is np.float32. For convenience, np.uint8 or
    np.uint16 is also accepted. The intensity of such images is scaled
    by a factor of 255 or 65535, respectively.
    
    We do not keep color information. If YxXxC images are provided, the
    color channel is averaged away with equal weights for each channel.

    An Image is just a numpy array with the following additional methods:

        stretch - Strech contrast of an image in place
        stretched - Contrast-stretched copy of an image
        scaled - Geometrically scale an image down by integer factor
        apodize - Multiply a windowing function into an image in place
        apodized - Apodized copy of an image
        ascii - ASCII-art representation of an image
        save - Save an image to a file
