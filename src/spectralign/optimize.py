        OPTIMIZE(ppa, ppb) calculates the affine transform that best
        maps the points PPA (2xN matrix) to the points PPB (ditto).

        If there are three or fewer points, the result is exact, i.e.,
        a transform A for which A * PPA = PPB. In particular:

          - If there is only one pair of points, the result is a
            simple translation;
          - If there are two, a translation combined with an
            isotropic scaling and rotation;
          - If there are three, a perfectly fitting affine transform.

        If there are more than three pairs, the result is the least-
        squares solution:

            rms = sqrt(sum(||AFM * PPA - PPB||Â²))

        is minimized.

        In the special case of two points, the transform may be forced
        to be a pure rotation + translation (i.e., no scaling) by
        passing in True for the ROTATION flag.

        The points may also be provided as N-element lists of 2-vectors.
