# spectralign - Spectral methods for aligning image stacks

## Introduction

Spectralign is a re-implementation of the SWIFT-IR algorithm by Art
Wetzel of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, which was described in
[Wetzel et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2016.8010595). 

This implementation presents an object-oriented interface to the
algorithm and some examples of use are included.

## Installation

Spectralign may be obtained by

    pip install spectralign
    
## Examples

## Development

Development of spectralign is on 
[github](https://github.com/wagenadl/spectralign).

## Acknowledgments

The original algorithm was written in C by Art Wetzel. The most recent
version of that project is at
[github.com/mcellteam/swift-ir](https://github.com/mcellteam/swift-ir). 
(That repository also
includes an earlier version of my Python implementation as well as a
GUI that uses it.)
